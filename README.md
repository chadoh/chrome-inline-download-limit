Downloading inline images: what's the file size limit?
==========

Answering [a question I posed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47353040/when-trying-to-download-inline-images-in-chrome-what-is-the-file-size).

Chrome displays odd behavior when trying to download inline, data-encoded images. If the image is small enough, it works fine. If the image is too large, Chrome chokes on it. This small html file demonstrates the file sizes at which this starts happening.
